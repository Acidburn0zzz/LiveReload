# Reactive Models for JavaScript

Reactive.js is a _reactive enviroment_ and a _modelling library_ for _desktop apps_ written in JavaScript.

As a _reactive environment_, Reactive.js provides automatic dependency tracking for your models and view models / controllers, eliminating the need to emit and subscribe to change events:

> If you render a status bar using `mainScreen.statusText` value, which is computed based on `app.connectionCount` value and `app.messages` collection, then whenever one of those source values are updated, `statusText` value is automatically re-computed, and then the status bar rendering code is automatically re-invoked.

As a _modelling library_, Reactive.js:

* allows you to define models, collections and their attributes;
* provides type-checking, type coercion, default values and other goodies for attributes;
* allows you to split model classes into several mixins;
* defines creation and disposal behavior of the models.

As a library aimed for _desktop and desktop-style apps_, Reactive.js is completely oblivious to any client/server data transfer issues, which, in its present state, probably makes it unsuitable for most web apps.

Reactive.js does not currently provide any data-binding facilities; those can be developed on top of it.

State: pre-alpha.


# Getting Started

## Installation

Clone this repo; not yet published on npm.


## Hello World Example

A model that automatically outputs a greeting every time the name is updated:

    function App() {}

    App.schema = {
      name: { type: String }
    };

    App.prototype.automatically_say_hello = function() {
      console.log("Hello, " + this.name + "!");
    };

To use it, we need to create a universe and register the model class first:

    var universe = new R.Universe();
    universe.define(App);

Then we can create and use the model:

    var app = universe.create('App', { name: 'world' });
    setTimeout(function() {
      app.name = "stranger";
    }, 1000);

Outputs:

    Hello, world!
    Hello, stranger!         (after 1 sec)


## Status Bar Example (CoffeeScript)

A console app that re-renders its status bar whenever the connection count or the message list is updated (which is simulated every couple of seconds):

    class App_Basics
      schema:
        mainScreen:          { type: 'MainScreen' }
        connectionCount:     { type: 'int' }
        messages:            { collection: 'list', type: 'Message' }

      initialize: ->
        @mainScreen = @universe.create('MainScreen')

    class App_Handlers
      initialize: ->
        @authors = ['Paul', 'Bob', 'Rick', 'Mike', 'Jeff']

      clientConnected: ->
        @connectionCount += 1

      messageReceived: ->
        author = @authors.shift(); @authors.push(author)
        @messages.push @universe.create('Message', author: author, text: "Hello!")

    class Message
      schema:
        author:              { type: String }
        text:                { type: String }

    class MainScreen
      schema:
        app:                 { type: 'App', injected: yes }
        statusText:          { type: String }

      compute_statusText: ->
        lastMessage = @app.messages.last()
        "#{app.connectionCount} connections, last message from #{lastMessage?.author or 'nobody'}"

      automatically_render_statusText: ->
        console.log "statusText = #{@statusText}"

    exports.run = ->
      universe = new R.Universe()
      universe.define(App_Basics, App_Handlers, Message, MainScreen)
      app = universe.create('App')
      setInterval app.clientConnected.bind(app), 1500
      setInterval app.messageReceived.bind(app), 2500

Outputs:

    0 connections, last message from nobody
    1 connections, last message from nobody           (after 1.5 sec)
    1 connections, last message from Paul             (after 2.5 sec)
    2 connections, last message from Paul             (after 3.0 sec)
    3 connections, last message from Paul             (after 4.5 sec)
    3 connections, last message from Bob              (after 5.0 sec)
    ...

Key facts to observe here:

* models are plain JavaScript classes registered via `universe.define`;
* those JavaScript classes are actually mixins; multiple mixins may be combined into a single model class (e.g. `App_Basics` and `App_Handlers` mixins are combined into `App`); mixins follow `ModelName_MixinName` naming convention;
* attributes must be explicitly defined in a _schema_ if you want Reactive.js to know about them (of course, you can still use regular JavaScript fields like `authors` in our example; those are simply be ignored by the framework)
* a method named `computed_smt` must correspond to a schema-defined attribute and is invoked to set the value of the attribute; any attributes accessed by the method are tracked as dependencies, and the method is re-invoked when its dependencies are updated;
* a method named `automatically_smt` is invoked shortly after the model is created; any attributes accessed by the method are tracked as dependencies, and the method is re-invoked when its dependencies are updated.


# Concepts

## Reactivity

TODO: explain more, although the idea should be pretty clear by now.

## Entities and Mixins

TODO.

Reactive.js supports multiple inheritance of entities, which works the way you'd expect (using Python-style DFS ordering for conflicting members). The list of superclasses is specified via `$extends` key of a schema:

    class Rule
      ...

    class FileToFileRule
      schema:
        $extends: 'Rule'  # or ['Rule', 'SomeOtherEntity']

Note that you specify entity kind names, not mixin names/classes.

Entity inheritance is used for type checking and to share implementations. The following implementation details are inherited:

* attribute definitions (and everything else that might be defined by a schema in the future)
* class prototype members
* automatic blocks (`automatically_do_something`)
* initialize hooks (`initialize(attrs)`), other hooks in the future

One could say that a child entity inherits the parent entity's mixins. There's a twist, however: sibling mixins cannot override each others' attributes and methods, but the members defined in a child entity _do_ override the inherited members.

There's no easy way to call super implementation from an overridden method, sorry. Once I encounter a use case for that, I'll figure something out.


## Attributes and Schemas


## Types

### Valid type descriptors

Simple types:

* `undefined` or `'any'` — any value, defaults to `undefined`
* `'int'` — integer value, defaults to zero
* `'number'` or `Number` — numeric value, defaults to zero
* `'string'` or `String` — string value, defaults to an empty string
* `MyClass` or `{ object: MyClass }` — instance of a specified class, has no default value

Compound types:

* `'array'` or `Array` — array of any values, defaults to an empty array
* `{ array: itemType }` — array of values conforming to itemType descriptor, defaults to an empty array
* `[type1, type2, type3]` — “or”: value conforming to one of the specified types, defaults to type1's default value

Reactive library types:

* `'SomeEntity'` — registered entity
* `'SomeDuckType'` — registered duck type

Nullability:

* the only types that accept null values are `'any'` and `null`
* all other types, for instance object and entity types, do _not_ accept nulls
* use `null` type with an “or” descriptor to allow nulls, e.g. `[null, 'string']` or `{ array: [null, 'int'] }`
* alternatively, for descriptors specified as a string, append `?` to the string to allow nulls, e.g. `'string?'`, `'MyEntity?'`, `{ array: 'int?' }`


# API

## R.Universe

A top-level context for reactive models.

Normally, an app only has a single instance of Universe, and when running tests, every test has its own universe.


### new R.Universe()

Creates a new empty universe; takes no arguments.

    universe = new R.Universe()


### universe.define(arg1, [arg2, arg3], arg4)

Adds the given definitions to the universe. Define recursively processes its arguments and any arrays given as arguments (and arrays within arrays, etc). The individual definitions must conform to the syntaxes given below.


#### Defining a mixin

    universe.define(mixinClass)
    universe.define({ klass: mixinClass })

Mixes the given `mixinClass` (which must be a JavaScript function with a prototype) into a similarly-named entity kind, creating the kind if it does not exist.

Specifically:

* all prototype attributes and methods are copied into the entity class prototype;
* all static attributes and methods (i.e. those defined on the function itself) are copied into the entity class.

The _entity kind name_ and the _mixin name_ are derived from the name of the given function. For that, `mixinClass.name` must be defined and non-empty (which happens automatically with most JavaScript engines). If `mixinClass.name` contains an underscore (`Foo_Bar`), the first part is used as an entity kind name, and the second part as a mixin name. If `mixinClass.name` does not contain an underscore, it is used as an entity kind name, and the mixin name is empty.

Note that the given function is never invoked, and thus `mixinClass` is never instantiated; it is only used for its members. Any prototype methods are always invoked with the actual entity in `this`.

The following keys are treated specially and are _not_ copied into the entity class:

* `mixinClass.prototype.initialize(attributes)` is invoked when a new model instance is created;
* `mixinClass.prototype.schema` or `mixinClass.schema` is an object that defines attributes and other metadata of the entity (see below).


#### Defining a duck type

    universe.define({ name: 'Foo', duck: { key: value } })

TODO.


### universe.create(kindName, attributes)

Creates a new entity of the given kind, initialized with the given attribute values. Returns an instance of an entity class defined by the reactive library, which derives from `R.Entity` and has all defined mixins applied.

`kindName` must be a string identifying a known entity kind.

`attributes` is an optional hash. Keys matching the names of defined attributes will be assigned to those attributes. All other keys can be handled inside `initialize` methods of mixin classes.


### universe.performAndWait(func, callback)

Performs the given function and waits until all side effects are processed. Most useful in tests that want to check a computed attribute after updating a source one.

Works by scheduling the given function as a ONESHOT task, then addeding the given callback as a finalization handler of the task invocation.


### universe._r_id

In all classes defined by the reactive library, `_r_id` is a unique immutable string value that can be used to identify a given object from elsewhere (especially useful as a dictionary key).


### universe.dispose()

Destroys the universe, cancels any universe-related activity that can be cancelled.


## R.Entity

A base class for all reactive models.

Keep in mind: while the (automatically defined) model classes derive from R.Entity, your mixin classes do not, so you should not reference this class in your code:

* you do _not_ derive from R.Entity; write mixin classes and register them via `universe.define` instead;
* you do _not_ instantiate R.Entity or its subclasses directly; use `universe.create` instead.


### entity.isReactiveEntity

Always `true`; use this for duck-type instance-of checks. Do `if (entity.isReactiveEntity)`, don't do `if (entity instanceof R.Entity)`.


### entity.universe

Every entity class is bound to a specific instance of Universe, which can be accessed via `EntityClass.prototype.universe` and via `entity.universe`. This is most often used to invoke `this.universe.create(...)` from within the entity.


### entity . _attr_

Attributes defined by a schema are directly exposed on an Entity. E.g. if your schema defines attribute `foo`, you can access it as `entity.foo` and `entity.foo = 42`.


### entity.get(attr), entity.set(attr, value)

Backbone-compatible get/set methods accepting a string `attr` name. They invoke individual attribute getters/setters, so should behave exactly the same way.

Unlike in Backbone, you cannot get/set arbitrary attributes; every attribute accessed by these methods must be defined in the entity's schema.


### entity.isKindOrSubclass(kind)

Returns true if the entity is of the specified kind, false otherwise. (When entity inheritance is added, will also return true when the entity is a subclass of a given kind.)


### entity._r_id

In all classes defined by the reactive library, `_r_id` is a unique immutable string value that can be used to identify a given object from elsewhere (especially useful as a dictionary key).



## Mixins, Lifecycle and Magic Methods

A mixin can define the following special methods which are not copied into the entity class.


### MyMixin.prototype.automatically_smt

Any method that starts with `automatically_` is invoked when the model is instantiated, _inside a reactive task_; it will be invoked again when the values of any accessed attributes are updated.

For example, this class continuously logs the current value of SimpleEntity.someValue to console:

    class SimpleEntity
      schema:
        someValue:           { type: 'int' }

      automatically_log_someValue: ->
        console.log "@someValue = #{@someValue}"


## Attributes and Schemas

A schema is a JavaScript object specified as `MixinClass.schema` or `MixinClass.prototype.schema`. (The latter version is a convenience for CoffeeScript users; putting the schema into the prototype does not make much sense otherwise.)

Every key of the schema is an attribute name, and the value defines the attribute's metadata. Keys starting with a dollar sign are special and do not correspond to attributes. E.g.:

    class Message
      schema:
        $mixins: [Bar, Boz]
        name:    { type: String }
        author:  { type: [null, 'Person'] }
        demo:    {}

An attribute metadata with a `collection` key defines a collection, which adds more keys and alters the meanings of some other keys; see the dedicated section on collections.


### Schema key: `$extends`

Specifies a list of entity kinds to inherit from. Must be a string or a list of strings.


### Schema key: `$includes`

Specifies a list of mixins to include into the current mixin's entity. Must be a class or a list of classes; the classes are something that you could pass to `universe.define`, short for the naming convention (you don't have to prefix included mixins with the entity name; you can have shared mixins that are included into multiple entities).


### Schema key: `$mixins`

Not implemented yet, and might never be. :-)

Specifies a list of mixins to define when this mixin is defined; must be an array of JavaScript functions that can be passed to `universe.define`.


### Magic methods

Some attribute metadata keys can be provided as mixin prototype methods. E.g. a method named `compute_foo` specifies a function for the `compute` key of the `foo` attribute's metadata.

The following magic methods are defined:

* `get_foo` — foo's `getter`
* `set_foo` — foo's `setter`
* `compute_foo_` — foo's `compute`
* `initialize_foo` — foo's `initializer`

To avoid typos, any method starting with one of the magic names _must_ correspond to an existing attribute, otherwise an error is thrown at mixin registration time.


### Attribute metadata: type (not implemented yet)

Limits the attribute value to the specified types; if `null` is not one of the types, the attribute must be initialized to a non-null value.

Defaults to `[null, 'any']`.


### Attribute metadata: default

Specifies the initial value for the attribute. This value will be used when creating new entities unless another value is provided to the constructor (in the `attributes` dictionary).

    schema:
      eventCount: { type: 'int', default: 42 }

Defaults to the appropriate value for the attribute type (null for `null`, 0 for `int`, empty string for `String`).


### Attribute metadata: compute

Specifies a function that provides a value for this attribute. The function will be called shortly after the model is created. The call is made inside a reactive task, so any accessed attributes will be tracked as dependencies, and the call is repeated when the dependencies are updated. The value of `this` is the model instance.

The function must accept zero or one arguments. A zero-argument compute function must be synchronous and must return the new value. A one-argument function is asynchronous and is invoked as `compute(callback)`; the return value is ignored, and the callback must be eventually called as `callback(err, newValue)`. Reactive.js guards against re-entrance; if the function is already running, it will not be called again until the callback is invoked.

Can (and probably should) be specified as `compute_attrName` magic method. Defaults to null.


### Attribute metadata: getter

A method to call (synchronously) to read the value of the attribute. This key is currently only supported for non-reactive attributes (`reactive: false`).

Can be specified as `get_attrName` magic method.


### Attribute metadata: setter

A method to call (synchronously) to update the value of the attribute. This key is currently only supported for non-reactive attributes (`reactive: false`).

Can be specified as `set_attrName` magic method.


### Attribute metadata: initializer (not implemented yet)

Can be specified as `initialize_attrName` magic method. Defaults to null.


### Attribute metadata: reactive

When set to false, turns off reactive behavior for this attribute. If a getter/setter is specified, `Object.defineProperty` will be used to define this attribute on the model class prototype. If there's no getter and no setter, there will be no
property accessor defined, so reads and writes will be accessing the actual JavaScript field.

Here's a full list of reasons why you might want to define a non-reactive attribute:

* to define a virtual property (`Object.defineProperty`) with a given getter and setter (note that Reactive.js won't copy properties from the mixin prototypes, so this is the only way to define a virtual property)
* to allow reading/writing a field via get() and set() methods
* (not implemented yet) to make the attribute visible to the automatic dependency injection system (note that dependency injection for reactive attributes only exists in my head so far)
* just to have it listed in the schema, as a sort of a fucked way to declare your public API
* (not implemented yet) to provide a default value inside the schema (note that a simple assignment in a constructor would do just fine for that)
* (not implemented yet) to enable type-checking and coercion of assigned values (in the future versions, Reactive.js will define accessor methods to automatically perform checking/coercion if you specify the attribute type)


## Collections

Example collection attribute:

    systemRubies: { collection: 'list', type: 'LRRuby' }


### Collection attribute metadata: collection (required)

Specifies a collection class; this must either be one of the predefined string values, or a JavaScript function.

Predefined collection classes:

* `list` specifies R.ListCollection.


### Collection attribute metadata: type (required)

Specifies the element type of the collection. Must be one of the defined entity kinds (we don't support non-entity collections yet).


# Private API

## Tasks

Generally, a task is a separately scheduled unit of work. Reactive.js uses tasks for 4 purposes:

* to provide a way to schedule and prioritize the background work (like recomputation of computed properties);
* to track completion of the given work with all its side effects;
* to establish reactive environment boundaries and associate dependencies metadata with reactive code;
* to handle errors in an organized way.

Reactive.js provides a simple task queue, but the queueing aspects are not the primary focus of the framework. In the future we anticipate an API to integrate Reactive.js tasks with more sophisticated queuing solutions.

Reactive.js defines ONESHOT, MULTISHOT and AUTOREPEAT task types:

* One-shot tasks are only ever executed once; they are primarily used to track completion of initialization operations.
* Multi-shot task can be invoked multiple times (manually), although Reactive.js guarantees that if a task is already running, further invocations are postponed until the current invocation completes.
* Autorepeat tasks are multi-shot tasks that track any attributes accessed during their execution, and are automaitcally reinvoked when those dependencies are updated.

Tasks can be synchronous and asyncronous. Reactive.js uses Node.js domains to make any asyncronous callbacks part of their originating task, and to treat any exceptions thrown by those callbacks as a failure of the task.

A task belongs to a given entity, which is used to automatically dispose tasks (especially autorepeat tasks) when their owner entity is disposed.


### Task invocations

Tasks have _invocations_; at any given time, a task has zero or one _scheduled_ invocations, zero or one _running_ invocations, and zero or one _completed_ invocations. (Of course, a one-shot task can only have a single invocation ever; it will refuse to schedule an invocation if another one is already running or completed.)

Dependencies are tracked by _invocations_; autorepeat tasks subscribe to the most recently completed invocation's dependencies.


### Completion, finalization and subtasks

A task invocation is _completed_ when the task's code and all its asynchronous work has completed (succeeded or failed).

A task invocation is _finalized_ when it has completed, and any side-effects (e.g. computed properties recomputation) scheduled during its execution have completed too.

Completion is typically used when a task needs to invoke another task and wait for it to complete before doing further work, while finalization is typically used by the tests to check the side effects of a specific operation.

Completion and finalization is tracked by task invocations; when you schedule a task, you get a scheduled invocation back which you can subscribe to (`invocation.waitCompleted` and `invocation.waitFinalized`).

If task A is scheduled while another task B is running, the scheduled invocation of task A becomes a _child_ of the running invocation of task B. Parent-child relationships are used to track finalization: invocation A is finalized iff it is completed and all its child invocations are finalized.


### Tasks API

The raw tasks API is typically hidden behind more convenient APIs like `compute_smt` or `automatically_smt` magic methods. We intend to keep the Tasks API for private use and expose use case-specific wrappers instead.

For now, though, you might be forced to deal with the raw API, particularly in tests. It is a bit of a mess, and the API is subject to change at any time.

You'll be dealing with 3 objects: R.TaskDef (a definition that can be shared by multiple entities), R.Task (an actual task that binds R.TaskDef instance to a given entity) and R.TaskInvocation.

To speed up creation of many similar tasks, pretty much everything about a task needs to be described as a R.TaskDef first. Right now this merely saves a bit of memory, but in the future, some heavier processing may be performed with TaskDefs (like maybe determining a priority).

R.TaskDef accepts a function that must accept 0, 1 or 2 arguments. If it accepts 2 arguments, it is called as `func(entity, callback)` and the task is asynchronous. Otherwise, it is called as `func(entity)` and the task is synchronous. The entity is also used as `this` value for the func, so if the function is a method of an entity, you don't need to bind it.

Here's how you can create a one-off task and wait for its finalization:

    class Dummy
    universe.define(Dummy)
    dummy = universe.create(Dummy)

    task = new R.Task dummy, new R.TaskDef universe, "Dummy", R.TaskDef.ONESHOT, (entity) ->
      console.log "I'm a task, and I am running"

    task.schedule().waitFinalized ->
      console.log "My invocation is completed, I could check side effects here!"

Here's how an entity can create a multishot task:

    class MainWindow

      schema:
        someAttr: { type: 'int', default: 1 }
        anotherAttr: { type: 'int' }

      initialize:
        # share a single TaskDef among all class instances
        @constructor.buttonTaskDef or= new R.TaskDef(@universe, "Dummy", R.TaskDef.ONESHOT, @handleButton)

        @buttonTask = new R.Task(this, @constructor.buttonTaskDef)

        setInterval =>
          @buttonTask.schedule().waitFinalized =>
            console.log "Now all side effects caused by @someAttr++ in handleButton() have been processed"
            console.log "In particular, now @someAttr == #{@someAttr} and @anotherAttr == #{@anotherAttr}"
        , 1000

      handleButton: ->
        console.log "Button pressed!"
        @someAttr++
        console.log "Note that @anotherAttr == #{@anotherAttr}, but @someAttr == #{@someAttr}"

      compute_anotherAttr: ->
        @someAttr * 100
